The purpose of this exercise was to use MapBox API calls in conjunction with the JavaScript library 'leaflet.js' to plot out a visualization of the most current global earthquake activity, as well as the location of the world's tectonic plates.

## Conclusion

___

This exercise ended up being very informative, and fun. The flexiblility offered in JavaScript has already been something that I did not think I would enjoy as much as I have. When paired with libraries like D3 and Leaflet, it becomes very apparent as to why JavaScript is used for data visualiztion so often.    
While Python and SQL are seemingly unparalleled at data handling, ETL, and querying, the MatPlotLib packages we learned earlier, while fun, did not look all that great, and were restrictive in sharing and being viewed by others. JavaScript, however, makes it easy to share pages, and the libraries we've learned make the data automatically interactive.
